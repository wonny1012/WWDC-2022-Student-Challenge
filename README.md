"Zoochestra" An educational app that introduces orchestra instruments using animals. 
In Korean education, only popular instruments (for example, violin, cello, flute) are briefly described. 
In order to gain knowledge and interest in various instruments, it was expressed as an animal of similar size and sound.  
If you click on an animal, you can hear the actual sound of the instrument. You can also hear what group the instrument belongs to, what other instruments are there, and what sounds the group makes.
The technology used is "NavigationView","Stack" ,"Spacer" and "AVpalyer".
Let's go see the lovely animals and listen to the beautiful sounds of musical instruments
